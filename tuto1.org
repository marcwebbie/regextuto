* Regex Tutorial 1

** TODO Introduction

   If you ever wanted to learn an exoctic language...
   In this tutorial you will learn to write stuff like this:

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   r"https?://(?:(?:www)|(?:embed))?\.novamov.com/(?:(?:video/)|(?:embed\.php\?v\=))(?P<id>\w+)"
   #+END_SRC

*** TODO What is regular expression?

    Regular expressions (called REs, or regexes, or regex patterns) are essentially a tiny,
    highly specialized programming language embedded inside Perl/Python/Ruby/Lisp/Java and
    other programming languages.

    Using this little language, you specify the rules for the set of possible strings that
    you want to match; this set might contain English sentences, or e-mail addresses, or
    TeX commands, or anything you like.
    You can also use REs to modify a string or to split it apart in various ways.

    For a detailed explanation of the computer science underlying regular expressions
    (deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata), you can refer to almost any
    textbook on writing compilers. (We have the Dragon Book in portuguese at the office)


** TODO Simple Patterns

   Since regular expressions are used to operate on strings, we’ll begin with the most common
   task: matching characters.

*** TODO Matching Characters

    Most letters and characters will simply match themselves. For example, the regular expression
    r"test" will match the string "test" exactly.

    However some characters doesn't match themselves, instead they signal that something /out-of-ordinary/
    should be matched. Those are the most confusing part of regular expressions.
    They are called metacharacters

    here is the complete list of Metacharacters

    #+BEGIN_SRC python
    r". ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )"
    #+END_SRC

***** [ ]

      They’re used for specifying a character class, which is a set of characters that you wish to match.

      examples:

      | class | will match...                                 |
      |-------+-----------------------------------------------|
      | [abc] | any of the characters "a", "b", or "c";       |

      Using dashes you build ranges

      | class | will match...                  |
      |-------+--------------------------------|
      | [a-c] | any character from a to c;     |
      | [a-z] | any character from "a" to "z"; |

      Metacharacters are not active inside classes

      | class  | will match...                                |
      |--------+----------------------------------------------|
      | [akm$] | any of the characters 'a', 'k', 'm', or '$'; |
      | [xy*]  | any of the characters 'x', 'y', or '*';      |

      NOTE: that '$' is usually a metacharacter, but inside a character class it’s stripped of its special nature.

      You can match the characters not listed within the class by complementing the set.
      This is indicated by including a '^' as the first character of the class;

      | class  | will match...                           |
      |--------+-----------------------------------------|
      | [^5]   | any character except '5';               |
      | [^a-z] | any non lower case character;           |
      | [xy*]  | any of the characters 'x', 'y', or '*'; |

***** Special sequences

    | Sequence | Description                             | Equivalent using classes |
    |----------+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------|
    | \d       | Matches any decimal digit;              | [0-9]                   |
    | \D       | Matches any non-digit character;        | [^0-9]                  |
    | \s       | Matches any whitespace character;       | [ \t\n\r\f\v]           |
    | \S       | Matches any non-whitespace character;   | [^ \t\n\r\f\v]          |
    | \w       | Matches any alphanumeric character;     | [a-zA-Z0-9_]            |
    | \W       | Matches any non-alphanumeric character; | [^a-zA-Z0-9_]           |
